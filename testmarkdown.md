1. **glycolysis** (occurs in the cytosol)

1 glucose breaks down into 2 pyruvate
net yield 2 (don't need to know how many produced just net yield)

| inputs         | outputs    |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| 1 glucose      | 2 pyruvaet |
| 2 adp + 2 Pi   | 2 ATP      |
| NAD+ (aka NAD) | NADH       |
don't need to know the details of the biochemical processes
